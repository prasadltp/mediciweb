They say, “LTP is defining The New Global FinTech.”

We consider that compliment as the best validation of what we do. The emerging financial services industry is now embracing the new definition of FinTech, and we are honored to be able to define the contours of this rapidly evolving space through the content and research we publish every day.

Let’s Talk Payments (LTP) was launched in August 2013 as a high-quality content and research platform for the expanding FinTech industry. Since then, LTP has reported on FinTech industry news and provides original insights every single day. LTP continues to be the fastest-growing payments and digital commerce news destination globally.

LTP has built the most comprehensive and effective news and insights platform for professionals in the industry, bringing deep research expertise to news reporting and analysis. Our contributors and subscribers are spread across the world in various segments of FinTech, which includes payments, financial services, banking, shopping, commerce, lending, insurance, compliance, etc… LTP continues to grow in scope and depth to cater to the needs of its readers.

LTP provides industry insiders and enthusiasts with an essential knowledge platform for news and insights. Our highly credible and trusted media channel (or portal?) helps marketers and entrepreneurs reach out to a collaboratively engaged audience. We delight our growing and diverse set of subscribers every day with analytical depth and comprehensive coverage delivered simultaneously.
